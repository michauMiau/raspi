Creating the blog
## The journey i went trough
Welcome to my first official post on this blog!
At the time of making this blog my 8GB Pi still hasn't arrived, so in
the meantime i thought i was gonna make this blog so i wouldn't have
to create it later. At first when i saw the first tutorial on google
i saw it and thought "Nahh, too much work" luckily there was another
tutorial which was way easier. So i grabbed the template and started  
modifying it to suit my needs. And this is where we are now.
The main reason why i wanted to create this blog combined with the videos is that i wanted
to have instructions also in the text form which, some people prefer (like me).
If you still haven't subscribed, please subscribe. I want this to be even my job in
the future, so that i can enjoy making videos and having viewers.
Your support is everything
(the reason why there are some grammar issues is because english is actually not my main launguage)
